    accept_focus(window::Window)

Check if the window `window` can accept focus and, if it can, then perform the
actions to change the focus.

 """

Return `true` if the widget `widget` is in focus on window `window`, or `false`
otherwise.

Process the focus on window `window` due to keystroke `k`.

Synchronize the cursor to the position of the focused widget in window `window`.
This is necessary because all the operations are done in the buffer and then
copied to the view.
