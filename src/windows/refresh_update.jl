Refresh the window with id `id` and all its parents windows except for the root
window.

Refresh the window `win` and its widget. If the view needs to be updated (see
`view_needs_update`) or if `force_redraw` is `true`, then the content of the
buffer will be copied to the view before updating.

Request to update the view of window `win`. Notice that this must also request
update on all parent windows until the root window.

Move the origin of the view of window `win` to the position `(y,x)`. This

Move the view of the window `win` to the position `(y+Δy, x+Δx)`. This function
has the same set of keywords of the function `move_view`.

    update_view(win::Window; force::Bool = false)

Update the view of window `win` by copying the contents from the buffer. If the
view does not need to be updated (see `view_needs_update`), then nothing is
done. If the keyword `force` is `true`, then the copy will always happen.
