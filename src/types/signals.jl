"""
    struct Signal

Defines a signal.

# Fields

- `connection::Function`: The function that is called when the signal is
    emitted. It must have the following API: `f(obj; kwargs...)`, where `obj`
    is the object that generated the signal. `kwargs` are keyword with values
    native to the signal and also selected during the connection.
- `kwargs::NamedTuple`: Additional keyword arguments passed to the connection
    function together with those native to the signal.
