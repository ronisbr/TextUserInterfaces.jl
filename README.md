TextUserInterfaces.jl
=====================

**WARNING**: This package should be considered beta!

This package wraps the C library **ncurses** and provide a Julia-like API to build text user
interfaces. The development was highly based on the package
[TermWin.jl](https://github.com/tonyhffong/TermWin.jl).

The API is not stabilized yet but we are using the package in some inside projects at the
Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE).

The documentation is not ready yet, but you can check the examples in the `examples/`
folder.
